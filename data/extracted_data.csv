"European Union, Framing, EU Attitudes, Experiment, Czech Republic, CEE, Risk and Opportunity framing, Eurozone, News frames",To assess to what extent do opportunity and risk frames regarding the Eurozone affect attitudes towards the EU.,To what extent and how do opportunity and risk news frames regarding the Eurozone affect citizens’ attitudes towards the EU?,(H1) People exposed to the opportunity news frame will have more favourable attitudes towards the EU than people exposed to the risk news frame.; (H2) The lower the political knowledge of individuals the more they will be affected by the news frames.,"The study utilized a survey-embedded experiment with a one factor (frames, two levels) between-subjects design, focusing on risk and opportunity news frames. Data was collected via social media and email, and included a manipulation check for the framing conditions.","The findings indicated that there was no significant effect of frames on any of the dimensions of EU attitudes, and the research aim was not achieved.","Future research should focus on larger and more representative samples, longitudinal studies of media effects on EU attitudes, and comparative designs between Eastern and Western Europe.",Filip Hanka,Dr. Joost van Spanje,"Graduate School of Communication, Communication Science: Political Communication",31. 1. 2019,not present,31242.pdf

"romantic movies, heteronormativity, gender roles, romantic ideals, love, relationships","To analyze how heterosexual young Dutch men experience mediated portrayals of love, romance, romantic relationships and romantic gender roles and how they relate these to their real-life romantic experiences.","What are the experiences of heterosexual Dutch young men regarding mediated- and everyday love, romance, and romantic gender roles, and how do they relate these mediated- and real-life experiences to one another?",not present,"The study employed a qualitative approach using grounded theory and in-depth semi-structured narrative interviews. Ten interviews were conducted with self-identified heterosexual young Dutch men aged 21 to 35, focusing on their experiences with mediated and personal everyday love, romance, and romantic gender roles.","The findings indicated that most participants experienced mediated love stories as unrealistic and unrelatable due to their more modern personal romantic experiences, while a few with more idealized experiences found them relatable. Overall, everyday experiences weighed more than mediated experiences in shaping their romantic beliefs.","Future research should explore the differences in experiences of older versus more recent movies, investigate dominant heterosexual courtship conventions further, and replicate the study with women to understand their experiences with mediated love stories.",Aquina Laban,"Dr. Rébecca Franco, Dr. Marie-Louise Janssen",MSc Sociology,"June 30, 2023",not present,c9065191.pdf

The data was analyzed through the theories of Social Imaginary and Governmentality.","The findings revealed that three major narratives (vulnerability, otherness, and dirtiness) negatively impact the citizenship status of sex workers, aligning with the research aim.","Further study is needed on the issue of sex work in the Netherlands, particularly on how different variables affect this topic and to strengthen the voices of sex workers in relation to sex work regulation.",Tess Mavrommati,Trudie Gerrits,MA in Medical Anthropology and Sociology,Summer 2023,Prostitution Information Center (PIC),c9164966.pdf

"automated information extraction, master's theses, locations, organisations, educational fields, methodologies","to develop a method of automatically, accurately and efficiently extracting specific information from thesis texts","From a thesis, (full-text) what is a way to extract accurate information about the country/city it was written in, the institute in which it was written and its topic? How can we make sure that the extracted data is accurate?",not present,"The study employed a proof-of-concept approach using a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, for information extraction from a purposive sample of 54 theses. The methodology followed the CRISP-DM framework, involving phases of business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Data was collected through web scraping, and validation involved comparing model outputs with human annotations.","The model performed reliably within the limited scope of the project, producing consistently structured outputs, but further refinement is necessary for validation and data acquisition.","Future work should prioritize building a scalable validation framework, expanding to a more representative sample, and incorporating additional metadata to improve the utility and reliability of the extracted information.",Bengisu Karaağaç,"Mathilde ter Veen, Robert Zwitser",not present,14 July 2025,Universitait van Amsterdam Bestuur Informatie,internship report.pdf
